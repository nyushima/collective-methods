^^^This was my first attempt, designed to output the Tweets, Tweet font size, and number of replies for the tweets of Felix Da Housecat. I can't yet tell what I'm doing wrong because it seems right to me, but unfortunately it is still giving me errors.

^^^My second code, inspired by Jingyi's post about finding posts about weather in Berlin, is designed to find posts about xiaolongbao in Shanghai.
But I wanted to use the woeid to name the location. Unfortunately This did not work either but I also think that I basically got it right.
As proof that some things that I do actually do what I intend, dispite my earlier frustrations, here is my code based on the examples that did work:
