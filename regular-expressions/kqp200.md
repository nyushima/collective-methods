##### Kevin's Regular Expressions/Beautiful Soup Work

I made two examples here, both doing the same sort of thing because I wanted to accomplish something similiar here. I have the basic gist but not exactly what I want.

MLB Top 50 Batting Averages (Of those, how many players play for the Seatle Mariners?)

<pre>
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import urllib.request
import re

url = 'https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/stats/bycategory?cat=Batting&conference=AL&sort=22'

page = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.read())

for mariners in re.findall('SEA', soup.get_text()):
    print(mariners)
</pre>

Yahoo Sports NBA Main Page (How many times the Golden State Warriors are mentioned)

<pre>
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import urllib.request
import re

url = 'https://sports.yahoo.com/nba'

page = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.read())

for warriors in re.findall('[Ww]arriors', soup.get_text()):
    print(warriors)
</pre>
